// What is comment

// Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
// the comment line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).
// This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
//	this is comment
	cout<<"Hi...I am Here"<<endl;
}
